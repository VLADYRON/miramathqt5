To run the source code the following Python extensions Python extensions must be installed:

PyQt http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk
PyQwt and PyQwt3D http://pyqwt.sourceforge.net/
Ply http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/
SymPy http://code.google.com/p/sympy/
SciPy http://www.scipy.org

If you are running Gentoo Linux then all of the above packages,except pqwtplot3d, are in portage. The later is not really needed since for now the 3D plotting feature is still experimental. Removing the line
Quote:
from PyQt4.Qwt3D import *
from plot3dwidget.py should remove this requirement.

After downloading the tarball type
Quote:
tar -xvjf filename
to unpack the source code.

To run Miramath type: python main.py in the same directory as the source code.
